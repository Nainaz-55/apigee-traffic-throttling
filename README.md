# apigee-traffic-throttling
his project demonstrates traffic management in Apigee using SpikeArrest and Quota policies. It shows how to rate-limit incoming requests, enforce per-entity quota limits for order creation, and configure quota settings in an API product to ensure fair usage and API reliability.

## Steps
- Added a SpikeArrest policy to protect against traffic surges.
- Added a Quota policy to limit the number of orders allowed for an app over a specific period of time.
